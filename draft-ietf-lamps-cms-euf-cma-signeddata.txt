         Best Practices for Signed Attributes in CMS SignedData
             draft-ietf-lamps-cms-euf-cma-signeddata-latest

Abstract

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) has different signature
   verification behaviour based on whether signed attributes are present
   or not.  This results in a potential existential forgery
   vulnerability in CMS and protocols which use CMS.  This document
   describes the vulnerability and lists best practices and mitigations
   for such a vulnerability.

1.  Introduction

   The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] signed-data content
   type allows any number of signers in parallel to sign any type of
   content.

   CMS gives a signer two options when generating a signature on some
   content:

   *  Generate a signature on the whole content; or

   *  Compute a hash over the content, place this hash in the message-
      digest attribute in the SignedAttributes type, and generate a
      signature on the SignedAttributes.  The SignedAttributes type is
      placed in the signedAttrs field of the SignedData type.

   The resulting signature does not commit to the presence of the
   SignedAttributes type, allowing an attacker to influence verification
   behaviour.  An attacker can perform two different types of attacks:

   1.  Take an arbitrary CMS signed message M which was originally
       signed with SignedAttributes present and rearrange the structure
       such that the SignedAttributes field is absent and the original
       DER-encoded SignedAttributes appears as an encapsulated or
       detached content of type id-data, thereby crafting a new
       structure M' that was never explicitly signed by the signer.  M'
       has the DER-encoded SignedAttributes of the original message as
       its content and verifies correctly against the original signature
       of M.

   2.  Let the signer sign a message of the attacker's choice without
       SignedAttributes.  The attacker chooses this message to be a
       valid DER-encoding of a SignedAttributes object.  The attacker
       can then add this encoded SignedAttributes object to the signed
       message and change the signed message to the one that was used to
       create the messageDigest attribute within the SignedAttributes.
       The signature created by the signer is valid for this arbitrary
       attacker-chosen message.

   This vulnerability was presented by Falko Strenzke to the LAMPS
   working group at IETF 121 [LAMPS121] and is detailed in [Str23].

   Section 5.3 of [RFC5652] states:

      signedAttrs is a collection of attributes that are signed.  The
      field is optional, but it MUST be present if the content type of
      the EncapsulatedContentInfo value being signed is not id-data.

   Thus, if a verifier accepts a content type of id-data in the
   EncapsulatedContentInfo type when used in SignedData, then a
   SignerInfo within the SignedData may or may not contain a signedAttrs
   field and will be vulnerable to this attack.  On the other hand, if
   the verifier doesn't accept a content type of id-data, the sender
   always adds the signedAttrs field, and the recipient verifies that
   signedAttrs is present, the attack will not succeed.

   The limited flexibility of either the signed or the forged message in
   either attack variant may mean the attacks are only narrowly
   applicable.  Nevertheless, due to the wide deployment of the affected
   protocols and the use of CMS in many proprietary systems, the attacks
   cannot be entirely disregarded.

   As a mitigation, this document defines the new mimeData content type
   to be used in new uses of the CMS SignedData type when the
   encapsulated content is MIME encoded and thus avoid the use of the
   id-data content type.  This document also describes best practices
   for the CMS SignedData type.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  mimeData Content Type

   The following object identifier identifies the mimeData content type:

     id-mime-data OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
         us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) smime(16) ct(1)
         TBD2 }

   The mimeData content type is intended as a replacement for the id-
   data content type in new uses of the CMS SignedData type where the
   content is MIME encoded.

4.  Best Practices

   This section describes the best practices to avoid the vulnerability
   at the time of writing.

   New uses of the CMS SignedData MUST NOT use the id-data
   EncapsulatedContentInfo content type.  If the new content is MIME
   encoded, the mimeData content type SHOULD be used.

4.1.  Existing Uses of id-data

   When a protocol which uses the id-data EncapsulatedContentInfo
   content type within SignedData is updated, it SHOULD deprecate the
   use of id-data and use a different (new or existing) identifier.  A
   partial list of such identifiers is found in the "CMS Inner Content
   Types" IANA subregistry within the "Media Type Sub-Parameter
   Registries".  If the existing content is MIME encoded, the mimeData
   content type SHOULD be used.  Updated protocols that do not deprecate
   the use of id-data SHOULD provide a rationale for not doing so.  Note
   that accepting the content type id-data during verification is
   sufficient for a vulnerability to surface.  Hence the measures
   described in Section 4.2 must be adhered to.

   When a protocol uses the id-data EncapsulatedContentInfo content type
   within SignedData, it SHOULD specify that the signedAttrs field is
   either always required or always forbidden.  If a protocol makes such
   a requirement, a recipient MUST check whether the signedAttrs field
   is present or absent as specified by the protocol, and fail
   processing if the appropriate condition is not met.

4.2.  Recipient Verification

   When a recipient receives a CMS SignedData, it SHOULD be checked that
   the EncapsulatedContentInfo content type value is the one expected by
   the protocol and fail processing if it is not.

   As specified in Section 5.3 of [RFC5652], a SignerInfo signedAttrs
   field MUST be present if the content type of the
   EncapsulatedContentInfo value being signed is not id-data.  To avoid
   the attack described in Section 1, when a recipient receives a CMS
   SignedData and the EncapsulatedContentInfo content type is not id-
   data, it SHOULD verify both that the expected content type was
   received and that each SignerInfo contains the signedAttrs field, and
   fail processing if either of these conditions is not met.

5.  Mitigations

   This section describes mitigations for cases where the best practices
   given above cannot be applied.  When the id-data
   EncapsulatedContentInfo content type is used, the following
   mitigations MAY be applied to protect against the vulnerability
   described in Section 1.

5.1.  Recipient Detection

   This mitigation is performed by a recipient when processing
   SignedData.

   If signedAttrs is not present, check if the encapsulated or detached
   content is a valid DER-encoded SignedAttributes structure and fail if
   it is.  The mandatory contentType and messageDigest attributes, with
   their respective OIDs, should give a low probability of a legitimate
   message which happens to look like a DER-encoded SignedAttributes
   structure being flagged.

      |  However, a malicious party could intentionally present messages
      |  for signing that are detected by the countermeasure and thus
      |  introduce errors into the application processing that might be
      |  hard to trace for a non-expert.

5.2.  Sender Detection

   This mitigation is performed by a sender who signs data received from
   a 3rd party (potentially an attacker).

   If the sender is signing 3rd party content and will not be setting
   the signedAttrs field, check that the content is not a DER-encoded
   SignedAttributes structure, and fail if it is.  Note that also in
   this case, a malicious party could intentionally present messages
   that trigger this countermeasure and thereby trigger hard-to-trace
   errors during the signing process.

6.  Security Considerations

   The vulnerability is not present in systems where the use of
   signedAttrs is mandatory, as long as recipients enforce the use of
   signedAttrs.  Some examples where the use of signedAttrs is mandatory
   are SCEP, Certificate Transparency, RFC 4018 firmware update, German
   Smart Metering CMS data format.  Any protocol that uses an
   EncapsulatedContentInfo content type other than id-data is required
   to use signed attributes.  However, this security relies on a correct
   implementation of the verification routine that ensures the correct
   content type and presence of signedAttrs.

   When the message is signed and then encrypted, the vulnerability
   could still be present if mitigations aren't applied:

   *  Signing and encryption might not be done on the same endpoints, in
      which case an attacker between the endpoints might be able to
      learn the signature for which it could remove or add the
      signedAttrs.

   *  IND-CPA encryption does not give theoretical guarantees against an
      active attacker and thus does not guarantee that an attacker
      cannot rearrange the structure.

   Conceivably vulnerable systems:

   *  Unencrypted firmware update denial of service

      -  Secure firmware updates often use signatures without
         encryption.  If the forged message can bring a device, due to
         lack of robustness in the parser implementation, into an error
         state, this may lead to a denial of service vulnerability.  The
         possibility of creating a targeted exploit can be excluded with
         greatest certainty in this case due to the lack of control the
         attacker has over the forged message.

   *  Dense message space

      -  If a protocol has a dense message space, i.e. a high
         probability that the forged message represents a valid command
         or the beginning of a valid command, then, especially if the
         parser is permissive with respect to trailing data, there is a
         risk that the message is accepted as valid.  This requires a
         protocol where messages are signed but not encrypted.

   *  Signing unstructured data

      -  Protocols that sign unencrypted unstructured messages, e.g.
         tokens, might be affected in that the signature of one token
         might result in the corresponding forged message being another
         valid token.

   *  External signatures over unstructured data

      -  The probably strongest affected class of systems would be one
         that uses external signatures, i.e. CMS or PKCS#7 signatures
         with absent content (that may be transmitted encrypted
         separately) over unstructured data, e.g. a token of variable
         length.  In that case the attacker could create a signed data
         object for a known secret.

   *  Systems with permissive parsers

      -  In addition to potential issues where the protocol parser is
         permissive (e.g. with respect to trailing space), if the CMS
         parser is permissive (e.g. allows non-protocol content types,
         or allows missing signedAttrs with content types either than
         id-data) then this could result in accepting invalid messages.

   It is generally not good security behaviour to sign data received
   from a 3rd party without first verifying that data.  Section 5.2
   describes just one verification step that can be performed, specific
   to the vulnerability described in Section 1.

                       Table 4: RFCs using id-data

   An RFC requiring or forbidding signed attributes does not necessarily
   mean that a recipient will enforce this requirement when verifying,
   their CMS implementation may simply process the message whether or
   not signed attributes are present.  If one of the signed attributes
   is necessary for the recipient to successfully verify the signature
   or to successfully process the CMS data then the vulnerability will
   not apply; at least not when assuming the signer is well-behaved and
   always signs with signed attributes present in accordance with the
   applicable specification.

A.1.  RFC 8894 Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol

   Figure 6 in Section 3 of [RFC8894] specifies id-data as the
   EncapsulatedContentInfo content type, and shows the use of
   signedAttrs.  The document itself never refers to signed attributes,
   but instead to authenticated attributes and an
   authenticatedAttributes type.  Errata ID 8247 clarifies that it
   should be "signed attributes" and "signedAttrs".

   Since SCEP requires the use of signedAttrs with the id-data
   EncapsulatedContentInfo content type, and the recipient must process
   at least some of the signed attributes, it is not affected by the
   vulnerability.

A.2.  RFC 8572 Secure Zero Touch Provisioning (SZTP)

   Section 3.1 of [RFC8572] allows the use of the id-data content type,
   although it also defines more specific content types.  It does not
   say anything about signed attributes.

A.3.  S/MIME RFCs

   [RFC8551], [RFC5751], [RFC3851], and [RFC2633] require the use of the
   id-data EncapsulatedContentInfo content type.

   Section 2.5 of [RFC8551] says:

      Receiving agents MUST be able to handle zero or one instance of
      each of the signed attributes listed here.  Sending agents SHOULD
      generate one instance of each of the following signed attributes
      in each S/MIME message:

   and

      Sending agents SHOULD generate one instance of the
      signingCertificate or signingCertificateV2 signed attribute in
      each SignerInfo structure.

   So the use of signed attributes is not an absolute requirement.

A.4.  RFC 6257 Bundle Security Protocol Specification

   Section 4 of [RFC6257] says:

      In all cases where we use CMS, implementations SHOULD NOT include
      additional attributes whether signed or unsigned, authenticated or
      unauthenticated.

   It does not specify what the behaviour should be if signed attributes
   are found by the receiver.

A.5.  RFC 5655 IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)

   [RFC5655] is a file format that uses CMS for detached signatures.  It
   says nothing about the use of signed attributes.

A.6.  RFC 5636 Traceable Anonymous Certificate

   Appendix C.1.2 of [RFC5636] says:

      The signedAttr element MUST be omitted.

   It does not specify what the behaviour should be if signed attributes
   are found by the receiver.

A.7.  RFC 5126 CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES)

   Section 4.3.1 of [RFC5126] specifies mandatory signed attributes.

   One of the signed attributes is used to determine which certificate
   is used to verify the signature, so CaDES is not affected by the
   vulnerability.

A.8.  RFC 5024 ODETTE File Transfer Protocol 2

   [RFC5024] uses the id-data EncapsulatedContentInfo content type and
   says nothing about signed attributes.

A.9.  RFC 3126 Electronic Signature Formats for long term electronic
      signatures

   Section 6.1 of [RFC3126] requires the MessageDigest attribute, which
   is a signed attribute.
